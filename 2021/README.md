# Advent of Code 2021

This directory contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenges.

## Setup

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

Each day's solution is in a separate Python file (e.g., `1.py`, `2.py`, `3.py`). The input data for each day is in a corresponding file (`input1`, `input2`, `input3`).

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
python3 day_number.py
```

For example, to run the solution for Day 1:

```bash
python3 1.py
```
