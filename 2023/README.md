# Advent of Code 2023

This directory contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges.

## Setup

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

## Usage

Each day's solution is organized into its own directory (`1`, `2`, `3`, etc.), containing a javascript file `script.js` and the input data for that day `input.txt`.

You can run a specific day's solution from any location by specifying the path to the javascript file:

```bash
node /path/to/2023/1/script.js
```
